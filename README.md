# Intro**: 
Perfect Green Screen takes an image in of your lit green screen and 
gives you a band view of the green screen showing all the gradation in the image (based on how graduated you want to see 
the image)

# Why is this important?

Well, its sort of like a zebra setting for every block of image range in your image.
Or a False color even (even though its all grey)

So for example if you set it to 10 bands - each band is approx a range 32 values in the gradation for each band.

The purpose when lighting a green screen is to keep the gradation to a minimum - to make it even as possible - 
thus have less gradation changes.

So if you see too many bands in your green screen, you know you need to have better lighting to make your key better.

Its a small but useful tool. One of many you should use.

# How does it work:

Two images are displayed
Left Image: Original Color Image
Right Image: Gradation Grey Scale Image

Bands: usually 10 or so is a good start to get good key.. with 1-2 bands for the green screen range
